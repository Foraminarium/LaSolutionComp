Raw laser data for MS: Comparison of laser ablation and solution based ICP-MS results for individual foraminifer Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca analyses by J. Fehrenbacher, T. Marchitto, and H. Spero published in G-cubed.

There is a total of four zip files. Three zip files contain the raw data files for the N. dutertrei, P. obliquiloculata, and T. sacculifer data. The data were obtained during different analytical runs and are groups by data of collection. One additional zip file contains the raw data files for O. universa.

Inside each unzipped file there is a folder that contains:
  1. The raw .csv data
  2. The LA tools file used to process the data
  3. A file describing the sample name (from manuscript tables 2-5), the associated raw data files, and the chamber number associated with each laser spot analysis (where chamber 0 = the final chamber, 1 is the F-1 chamber, etc).

Standards are included in each .csv folder.

The LaTools commands used for processing the data have the extension “.ipynb” and are included with each dataset.

Raw files include Al, Mg, Ca, and Sr data only.
